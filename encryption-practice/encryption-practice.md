### 🔹 Encryption Practice
  - Implemented AES and RSA encryption using Python and OpenSSL.
  
  - Practiced hashing and verification:
    ```
    md5sum file.txt
    sha256sum file.txt
    ```
  - Learned the differences between encryption, hashing, and encoding, and how to combine them for data integrity.
